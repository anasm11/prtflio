            <h3>The recursive cycle of tutorials</h3>
            <p><ins>If you tried to learn a skill in any domain on the internet, you would have stumbled upon a number
                    of video tutorials, most of which claim to take you from zero to hero within a very limited time
                    frame. And because of their high claims, people seem to be drawn very much towards them. Once you
                    start the tutorial and after the initial excitement period is over, you don't find it interesting
                    anymore. Some other tutorial starts looking interesting, and the cycle repeats. </p>


            <ins>This phenomenon is more common in the tech space with ever expanding ocean of knowledge, newer
                frameworks coming to the market, lower entry barrier in tech and also a good compensation(compared to
                other fields at least).

                Even if you end sticking with the tutorial till the end, to make up for the time invested, mere watching
                doesn't help much. Especially in the domain of coding, it can be learnt only by doing for the most part.
                Jumping from one tutorial to another, may not make one good at writing actual code.
                <p>
                    <strong style="display: block;">The solution</strong>
                    <ins>Tutorials do help, they are not bad, but to really learn,I beleive one must work and build
                        something out of it, break it apart and rebuild it again.
                        One simple step to follow might be, to have goal-oriented learning, i.e. to build something
                        based on the learning. Completing a mini project after tutorial improves the learning and also
                        helps in retention of knowledge. It can also serve as a way to show the proof of learning to a
                        potential employer. The joy of building is a bonus.

        <p>
            <strong>TLDR : </strong>
            Select good resources and BUILD instead of just them.
