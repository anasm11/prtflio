            <h2>Callbacks, promises and async/await in javascript</h2>
            <h3>
                Callback functions in javascript</h3>

            <ins>In javascript, it is possible to pass a function as an argument to another function. The function which
                is
                passed as an argument is called callback function.
                The callback function can be called at anytime inside the function to which it is passed. This gives us
                the
                control to call it as per the need when required.</ins>
            <p>
                Example syntax of callback:<br>
                <code>
                    function func2(){<br>
                    <ins>console.log('this is called back.')<br>
                        }<br><br>

                        function func1(callback){<br>
                        <ins>console.log('this is main function.')<br>
                            <ins>callback();<br>
                                }<br><br>
                                func1(func2);</code>
            </p>
            <ins>In the above example, func2 is called back from func1.

                This is particularly helpful in a scenario when we have to operate on data which is not available
                currently
                and has to be fetched from somewhere else. A good example would be in the case of an api call, where the
                data has to be fetched from another server and it may take some loading time. Also, in the case of async
                finctions where one function has to wait for another function, callbacks are useful. In promises,
                callback
                functions can be useful when called in .then block at the fulfilment/rejection of a promise.

                <br>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Promises</h3>
                A promise in javascript is like a promise in real life - an assurance to get something done. It works as
                a
                way to handle something whose value is not known currently. A promise can have 3 states: pending,
                fulfilled
                or rejected. A pending promise eventually can be fulfilled or rejected. When it is fulfilled , the .then
                handlers associated with it are called. A handler with .catch is added at the end, which gets called
                when
                the promise is rejected.

                <p>Example syntax for promise:<br>
                    <code> const promise1= new Promise(function(resolve,reject){<br>
                        <ins>setTimeout(function(){<br>
                            <ins>resolve('resolved');<br>
                                <ins>},1000);<br>
                                    })<br><br>

                                    promise1.then(handler1)<br>
                                    .then(handler2)<br>
                                    .catch(errorHandler);
                    </code>
                </p>

                <p> In the above example, promise1 is a promise created using new keyword.
                    The .then blocks have handlers which are chained with an ending .catch block.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3> Async/await in javascript</h3>
                <ins>Async/await are an easier way for writing asynchronous code.
                    Adding async in front of a function makes it asynchronous and returns a promise object.
                    await keyword is generally used while calling asynchronous functions returning promise(which may
                    take time
                    and whose value isnt known currently). It pauses the execution till the result of promise is
                    evaluated.

                    <p> Example syntax for async/await keywords:<br>
                        <code> async function fun(){<br>
                            try{<br>
                            <ins>await promise1;<br>
                                <ins>await handler1();<br>
                                    <ins>handler2();<br>
                                        }<br>
                                        catch(){<br>
                                        <ins>errorHandler();<br>
                                            <ins>}<br>
                                                }<br>

                                                fun();
                        </code>
                    </p>
